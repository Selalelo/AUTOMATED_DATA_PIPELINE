## üßæ Notes

- All models reside in the `dev` schema and follow a star schema convention.
- `fact_` prefix indicates fact tables with measurable metrics.
- `dim_` prefix is used for descriptive or categorical data.
- `stg_` prefix denotes staging models prepared from raw sources.
- Timestamps are converted to local time using the `utc_offset` column logic.
